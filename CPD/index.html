Flexbox basics command operations were covered in relation to legacy design methods to convey the step change that has been brought by the introduction of this postioning technology.</p>
    <h5>How did I use this in practice?</h5>
    <p>We were introduced to cssbattle.dev as a platform for the utilisation of CSS to change the appearance of web data on the page. An example was worked through to instruct on the usefulness of these examples.</p>
    <h5>What did I find hard?</h5>
    <p>I was unaware of the border radius commands in CSS which were needed for the example. I require further self learning in this area.</p>
