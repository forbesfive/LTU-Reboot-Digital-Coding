    <h4>CSS</h4>
    <h5>What have I learnt?</h5>
    <p>I learned that CSS is used to 'decorate' websites by using selectors to change the look and position of the data of the website provided by the html.</p>
    <h5>How did I use this in practice?</h5>
    <p>I was able to link my stylesheet to the html index file. This will be used within the 'box model' to arrange the data in a website for aesthetics, consistency and to ease use of the website by visitors to it.</p>
    <h5>What did I find hard?</h5>
    <p>There was nothing that I found difficult about todays lesson.</p>

    <h4>CSS - Positioning</h4>
    <h5>What have I learnt?</h5>
    <p>Use of CSS for positioning (Relative, Absolute & fixed). Learned the different Layout Design Methodologies of Graceful Degradation and Progressive Enhancement with the latter being thought to be the preferred method as it ensured that the design for mobile can be scaled up to the PC version of the webpage. Flexbox basics command operations were covered in relation to legacy design methods to convey the step change that has been brought by the introduction of this postioning technology.</p>
    <h5>How did I use this in practice?</h5>
    <p>We were introduced to cssbattle.dev as a platform for the utilisation of CSS to change the appearance of web data on the page. An example was worked through to instruct on the usefulness of these examples.</p>
    <h5>What did I find hard?</h5>
    <p>I was unaware of the border radius commands in CSS which were needed for the example. I require further self learning in this area.</p>

    <h4>Module 2 final project</h4>
    <h5>What have I learnt?</h5>
    <p>Set up from scratch the file structure for a Band promotion webpage for a performance at the LTU arms. Created file for index.htm, styles.css and scripts.js.</p>
    <h5>How did I use this in practice?</h5>
    <p>Gained familiarity with the separate sections of a webpage. Completing the relevant data through the use of Boilerplate data and completion of the relevant data in the appropriate tagged sections for the header, body and footer. Use of relevant markup in headers and paragraph tags in the body section in main and aside. External links used from Youtube and Spotify to link to video and audio content. Use of CSS to maniplulate the placement of html elements via functions. Responsive design through use of media queries to adapt the placement of the data dependent on the screen size.</p>
    <h5>What did I find hard?</h5>
    <p>This was fast paced and introduced a lot of concepts in quick succession. Although I kept up it gave little tinme to absorb the information for future use.</p>
